                If I, I get to know your name
                Well I could trace your private number, baby
                All I know is that to me
                You look like you're lots of fun
                Open up your lovin' arms
                I want some, want some
                I've set my sights on you
                (And no one else will do)
                And I, I've got to have my way now, baby
                All I know is that to me
                You look like you're havin' fun
                Open up your lovin' arms
                Watch out, here I come
                You spin me right 'round, baby
                Right 'round like a record, baby
                Right 'round, 'round, 'round
                You spin me right 'round, baby
                Right 'round like a record, baby
                Right 'round, 'round, 'round
                I, I got to be your friend now, baby
                And I, I would like to move in just a little bit closer
                All I know is that to me
                You look like you're lots of fun
                Open up your lovin' arms
                Watch out, here I come
                You spin meâ€¦
