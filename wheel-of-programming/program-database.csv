After each move, a message should be printed out that tells the user what just happened, and how much health the user and computer have.

,A Variation of 21,"In this project, you will make a game similar to 21/blackjack. Since this is not an actual game (as far as I'm aware of), here the the instructions for how to play. In this version, there is only one player, and there are two types of scores - the round score and the game score. The game score will begin at 100, and the game will last for five rounds. At the beginning of the round, the player is given two random cards from a deck and they will be added together to make the player's round score. From here, the player has two options - draw another card to try to get their round score closer to 21, or they can end the round. The player can draw as many cards as they want until they end the round or their round score exceeds 21. At the end of the round, the difference between 21 and the round score is subtracted from the game score, and then the next round begins. After the five rounds, the player is given their total score and the game is over. So the point of your program is to allow the user to play the game described above. Many of the subgoals listed below can be added to shine up the game. SUBGOALS 1) At the beginning of each round, print the round number (1 to 5). 2) Since this is a text base game, tell the user what is happening. For example, tell him/her when he/she draws a card, the name of the card, when they bust, etc. 3) Create a ranking system at the end of the game and tell the user their rank. For example, if the player finishes with 50-59 points they get an F, 60-69 is a D, 70-79 is a C, 80-89 is a B, and 90-100 is an A. 4) At the end of each round, print out the user's total score. 5) This may be the hardest part of the project, depending on how you wrote it. Make sure the deck has 4 of each type of card, and then remove cards as they are drawn. At the end of each round, make the deck have all of the cards again.","Easy - requires some thought, but a solution will present few difficulties",
,Compare Recent Karma,"If you go to a user's reddit profile and add .json to the end of it, you can get the all sorts of Json data about the user (think of Json as a giant dictionary of smaller dictionaries and lists). For example, if I go to my own profile and view it's Json data, it would look like this. At first it might look intimidating, but if you break it down, you can see it's just one giant dictionary with all sorts of information about my latest posts. GOAL Create a program that gets information about two different users, and then sees whose most recent post received the most karma. The program should then print out which user received more karma, and what the difference was. This is a pretty open project, so I encourage you to take it further by adding more features if you find it interesting. Remember - Elements in a list are referenced by their index numbers while entries in a dictionary are referenced by their keys. SUBGOALS 1) Allow the user to put in the name of two different users when the program first begins. 2) If one of the names of the users does not exist (because of a spelling error), print out a message saying so. 3) Allow the user to keep comparing other users until the program is closed. 4) Display the amount of upvotes and downvotes each user received for their posts.

,Watch for new TIL facts,"Create a program that receives data from the /r/todayilearned subreddit, and looks for new facts that have been posted. Each time the program comes across a new fact, the fact should be printed into the command line. However, phrases like ""TIL "", ""TIL that"", etc should be removed so the only thing that is printed is the fact. There are a couple things to note about this since you'll more than likely be using a loop to check for new posts. According to Reddit's API Access Rules Page, the API pages are only updated once every thirty seconds, so you'll have to have your code pause for at least thirty seconds before it tries to find more posts. Secondly, if for some reason you decide to try to get data sooner than every thirty seconds, make sure to not send more than thirty requests per minute. That is the maximum you are allowed to do. SUBGOALS (optional) There is actually a lot you can do once your program starts receiving facts. Instead of simply printing the facts, here are some ideas for what you can do with them. If you currently do not feel like you can accomplish these ideas, feel free to come back later when you have more experience. 1) Print the link to the source of the fact too. 2) Try to further clean up the fact by adding punctuation to the end if it is missing, capitalize the first word, etc. 3) Write the facts to a separate text file so you end up with a giant compilation of random facts. 4) Create a bot that posts the facts to twitter. This may sound hard, but it's simpler than it sounds.",Normal - a problem with typical or average challenges,
,Random Wikipedia Article,"BACKGROUND If you've been to Wikipedia, you may have noticed that there is a link to a random article on the left side of the screen. While it can be fun to see what article you get taken to, sometimes it would be nice to see the name of the article so you can skip it if it sounds boring. Luckily, Wikipedia has an API that allows us to do so. However, there is a dilemma. Since Wikipedia has articles about topics from all over the world, some of them have special characters in the title. For example, the article about the spanish painter Erasto Cortés Juárez has é and á in it. If you look at this specific article's API, you will see that the title is ""Erasto Cort\u00e9s Ju\u00e1rez"" and that the \u00e9 and \u00e1 are replacing the two previously mentioned letters. (For information about what this is, start by checking out the first half of this page in the documentation). To make your program work, you're going to have to handle this problem somehow. GOAL Create a program that pulls titles from the official Wikipedia API and then asks the user one by one if he or she would like to read about that article. So if the first title is Reddit, then the program should ask something along the lines of ""Would you like to read about Reddit?"" If the user says yes, then the program should open up the article for the user to read. SUBGOALS 1) As mentioned before, do something about the possibility of unicode appearing in the title. Whether you want your program to simply filter out these articles or you want to actually turn the codes into readable characters, that's up to you. 2) Make the program pause once the user has selected an article to read, and allow him or her to continue browsing different article titles once finished reading. 3) Allow the user to simply press ENTER to be asked about a new article.

SUBGOALS 1) Print out data for the next 5-7 days so you have a 5 day/week long forecast. 2) Print the data to another file that you can open up and view at, instead of viewing the information in the command line. 3) If you know html, write a file that you can print information to so that your project is more interesting. TIPS APIs that are in Json are essentially lists and dictionaries. Remember that to reference something in a list, you must refer to it by what number element it is in the list, and to reference a key in a dictionary, you must refer to it by it's name. Don't like Celsius? Add &units=imperial to the end of the URL of the API to receive your data in Fahrenheit.",Normal - a problem with typical or average challenges,
